# ReMarkable-scripts
Server-side bash scripts to use the ReMarkable tablet at its full potential.

The scripts work best if used all together.

Make sure that you read all the comments in each and every file to set them up correctly.

See the bottom of this file for instructions on how to demonize/run with cron.

The scripts do the following:
- upload.sh - Watch a folder on your server for new files, when a new file appears upload it to rmcloud/rmfakecloud
- mail.sh - Download attachments from a selected email account and move them to a folder synced with rmcloud/rmfakecloud through the upload.sh script
- convert.sh - Watch a directory and automatically convert .docx, .pptx files to pdf

## rmapi is being discontinued
Unfortunately rmapi is not being developed anymore. As long as it works, I will stick to it. If you have any other recommendation, please open an issue in this repository.

## upload.sh

`RMAPI_HOST="https://remarkable.mydomain.com" RMAPI_CONFIG_PATH="/root/.config/rmapi/rmapi.conf" /root/go/bin/rmapi`
- Generate and enter the code from remarkable cloud or rmfakecloud
- type `exit` to save the configuration

## mail.sh
Download attachments from a selected email account and move them to a folder synced with rmcloud/rmfakecloud through the upload.sh script.

Configuration:
- Look at the file .offlineimaprc to configure offlineimap
  - the location of the file is `~/.offlineimaprc`
- In .offlineimaprc, in the last line you can configure the trusted senders
  - There can be more than one trusted sender, separated by `|` like in the example file provided
  - Don't forget to escape characters (such as `.` and `_`) preceding them with a backslash `\`
- Run `chmod +x mail.sh`
- Change the settings in .offlineimaprc and place it in the user root folder `~/.offlineimaprc`

Features:
- Senders can be filtered
- Compatible with gmail, but need to configure less secure apps on gmail (here is an how-to: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255)
